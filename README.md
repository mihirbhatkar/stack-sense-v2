# stack-sense-v2

An expense tracker app made for me specifically. Basically a passion project ig idk. Obviously you can use it too if you like the concept

Key requirement of this app - it should not require an internet connection. Everything must be stored locally.

## Tech to be used:
- Flutter for frontend
- SQLite for db 
- No backend server required since literally everything is stored locally

## Concept of this app:
Expense tracker app. You will be able to set multiple income streams, your total income will be calculated based on that. Based on your total income, you can set multiple budgets/wallets. 

Suppose you have 50k total income, you can split that in multiple budgets of 10k, 15k, 25k and track how much you spent on a certain budget. You will also be able to set how much income is expendable, how much is going to tax and how much you are saving. Budget is basically a limit of spending on that particular category. Maybe I will rename it to wallet since that makes more sense maybe?

If you get low on a budget, the app will constantly remind you to not spend more. If you overspend the app will tell you that you are an idiot. Also, if you save too much expendable income, the app will tell you that you are an idiot because clearly you're not living your life to the fullest.

## Key deliverables:
- No internet connection required
- You will be able to track your expenses
- Should be fast
- UI should be good and expenses should be very quick to enter (since we wont use any external apis to automatically enter your expenses from gpay or other apps as that will require internet connection)
- Types of expenses - Normal expense, subscriptions(recurring until you cancel), emis(recurring with end date), (also investments maybe?)
- Charts
- Export data
